# NassWallet â€” Integration Notes

- Official site: `https://nass.iq/`
- GitHub org (samples/tools may appear here): `https://github.com/Nasswallet`

## Availability of developer docs
Public API documentation is typically provided after onboarding and signing a merchant agreement. Contact NassWallet to obtain:
- Merchant onboarding details and required documents
- API credentials and test environment access
- Full API specification and webhook/IPN details

## Suggested next steps
1. Reach out via the official site to request merchant onboarding and developer access.
2. Ask for sandbox credentials and the latest API documentation.
3. Implement server-side signature verification and webhook handling per their spec.
